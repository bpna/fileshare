# Comp 112 Final Project: Fileshare
## Nathan Allen, Jonah Feldman, Patrick Kinsella
### Description
This is a file server to allow simpler file sharing and backup. The base version of our application uses a client/server model, where one operator connects clients to one of a list of servers on which the client can store their files.
### Upcoming Features
- personal servers run by clients that provide outside access to their files
  - user can request operator to provide a backup service using traditional server model
- edit locks allow multiple users to work on the same file without overwriting each other
